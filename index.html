					<h2>The Foundation Truths <br>Hebrews 6: 1-2</h2>
					<p>The Foundation Truths are found in the book of Hebrews,
						chapter 6, verses 1 and 2. To better understand the importance of the foundation's, read the whole context which begins in Hebrews, chapter 5, verse 11 and ends in Hebrews, chapter 6, at verse 8. a context contains a complete
						thought or full picture. This study allows us to go back to the original Greek language, that the New Testament was written in, to get a more accurate picture of what the Holy Spirit said through the original authors. "Every
						scripture is god-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for discipline, which is in righteousness, that the man of God be complete, furnished completely unto every good work."

					<p>In Hebrews 6:1 it states,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine
						of Christ let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
						of repentance from dead works and a faith toward God."</p>
					<p>The foundations, listed in Hebrews 6:1 through too, are the first
						fundamentals of the image of Christ. As we learn about and practice
						these foundations, we will become more like our brother Jesus Christ.
						"My little children, of whom I am in travail until Christ be formed in
						you." As you read and practice the scriptures, you will start to see
						your life change into the likeness of Jesus.</p>

					<p>The elementary teachings or Foundation Truths are:
						<ol>
							<li>Repentance from Dead Works</li>
							<li>Faith on God</li>
							<li>The doctrine of Baptisms</li>
							<li>The Laying on of Hands</li>
							<li>Resurrection of the Dead</li>
							<li>Eternal Judgment</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>The Greek word for perfection, also found in Hebrews 6:1, is (teleon) and
						is more accurately translated as maturity or to be a full age. We can go
						on to maturity only after we have laid the good solid foundation, which
						is Jesus Christ.</p>
					<p>"For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is
						Jesus Christ." 1st Corinthians 3:11 (10-15). There is only one true
						foundation, Jesus Christ. There is only one place to learn about the
						foundation of Jesus and that is the Bible. It tells us everything we need
						to know about His Son.</p>
					<p>In Luke 6:46 - 49 it says that if we hear what Christ says and put it into
						practice (do what He says) we will be like the wise man who built his house
						upon the Rock. "He is like a man which built a house and dig deep and
						laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood a rose, the stream beat
						vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon
						a rock." The rock talked about there is Jesus.</p>
					<p>It is important when studying the scriptures to understand how God thinks.
						If we read the whole context, which is shown in parentheses by this study,
						we are more able to see and understand God's thought patterns and two more
						clearly see the whole picture. The next thing a Bible student needs to do
						is apply the scriptures to both our physical life and our spiritual life.
						The holy spirit will lead you into God's truth as you read and study these
						scriptures in the light of the whole context.</p>
					<p>The following is a list of six questions you should ask yourself while
						studying the foundations in order to better understand them. This is the
						same list Ray Haas gave me approximately 30 years ago when I first started
						my search to know God personally. I know that they will help you also
						help you in your search for the truth.</p>
